# React Monday Training | React Components

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to create a lot of React components.

To start this project, you can:

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

## `Greetings`

- `lang`: A string that could be ,`"de"`,`"en"`,`"es"`,`"fr"`
- `children`: A text 

**Example**

```

## `BoxColor`

Create a `BoxColor` component that display a square with a background color based on props. For this. You will need a styled component. 

It takes 3 props:
- `r`: A number between 0 and 255 representing the amount of red
- `g`: A number between 0 and 255 representing the amount of green
- `b`: A number between 0 and 255 representing the amount of blue

**Example**

<BoxColor r={255} g={0} b={0} />
<BoxColor r={128} g={255} b={0} />
```

As a bonus, you can also display the hex values of the color (ex: `#ff0000` for red).

## `CreditCard`

Create a `CreditCard` component that display a square with a background color based on props. For this. You will need a styled component. 

It takes 3 props:
- `type`: A string that can be `"Visa"` or `"Master Card"`
- `number`: A string that is number of the credit card. You will only display the 4 last digits for security reasons ðŸ˜‰
- `expirationMonth`: A number that represents the month, between 1 and 12
- `expirationYear`: A number that represents the year
- `bank`: A string that represents the name of the bank
- `owner`: A string the reprensents the name of the owner
- `bgColor`: A string for the background color of the card
- `color`: A string for the text color of the card

Take your time to do as close to the output. You probably have to use flexbox.

**Example**
```js
<CreditCard type="Visa" number="0123456789016984" expirationMonth={12} expirationYear={2019} bank="Name of the Bank" owner="Firstname Lastname" bgColor="#eecc55" color="white" />
